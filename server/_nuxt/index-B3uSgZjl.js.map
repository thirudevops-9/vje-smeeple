What information we share</h2>\n\n                    <p>We do not sell your Personal Information to third parties and the information disclosed is the minimum amount necessary to fulfill the legitimate business purpose. We do not share Personal Information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Smeeple except in the following circumstances:</p>\n\n                    <ul>\n                        <li><strong>With Your Consent</strong> - We may share your Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Smeeple when we have your consent to do so.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>Third-Party Service Providers</strong> - We may disclose your Personal Information to our third-party service providers who perform various functions on our behalf, but Smeeple requires these third parties to agree in writing to safeguard your Personal Information appropriately and in accordance with the law.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>For External Services</strong> - We may, from time to time, outsource some or all of the operations of our business to third-party service providers. In such cases, it may be necessary for us to disclose your information to those service providers. In some cases, the service providers may collect information directly from you on our behalf. We restrict how such service providers may access, use and disclose your information. We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. These agents may have access to your information as needed to perform their functions, but they are not permitted to use it for other purposes.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>For Legal Reasons</strong> - We may disclose any information about you when, in our opinion, such disclosure is necessary to prevent fraud or to comply with any statute, law, rule or regulation of any governmental authority or any order of any court of competent jurisdiction. We will share Personal Information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Smeeple if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: enforce applicable terms of use/service, including investigation of potential violations; detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Smeeple, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>In a Transaction</strong> - As we continue to develop our business, we might sell, buy or merge with companies, subsidiaries, or business units.

Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted through the Internet, and where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.</p>\n\n                    <h2>8.

We will consider any request you make to us, and provide a reply in a timely manner, according to our legal, ethical and contractual obligations. Some non-marketing communications are not subject to a general right to opt-out, such as communications about transactions and disclosures to comply with legal or ethical requirements.</li>\n\n                        <li><strong>Right to data portability</strong> - You have the right to data portability of your own personal data by contacting us. There are instances where applicable law or regulatory requirements allow or require us to refrain from transmitting your Personal Information to certain recipients or may require additional documentation before transmitting your information.

Terminating your account</h2>\n\n                    <p>You may terminate your account with us at any time through the account settings or emailing <a href=\"mailto:support@smeeple.com\">support@smeeple.com</a> Terminating your account will revoke any applicable consents or opt-ins but will be subject to any data retention requirements as described below.</p>\n\n                    <h2>10. Retention of collected information</h2>\n\n                    <p>Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulatory requirements, we will retain your Personal Information only for as long as we believe it is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the Personal Information was collected (including for the purpose of meeting any legal, accounting or other reporting requirements or obligations). You may request that we delete the Personal Information about you that we hold, as described above.</p>\n\n                    <h2>11. Accessing and updating your personal information</h2>\n\n                    <p>Whenever you use our Services, we aim to provide you with access to your Personal Information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it &ndash; unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your Personal Information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request. Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our Services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our Services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made by contacting <a href=\"mailto:support@smeeple.com\">support@smeeple.com</a>.</p>\n\n                    <h2>12.

In compliance with laws, we will not intentionally collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If we learn we have collected or received Personal Information from a child under 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete it. If you are the parent or guardian of a child under 18 years of age whom you believe might have provided us with their Personal Information, please contact us to request that it be deleted.</p>\n\n                    <h2>13. Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities</h2>\n\n                    <p>We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. If we receive a formal written complaint, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of Personal Information that we cannot resolve with our users directly.</p>\n\n                    <h2>14. California user privacy rights</h2>\n\n                    <p>For California residents: We may share your personal information with third parties and affiliated third parties (such as local, state and regional affiliates and affiliate alliances), some of which do not share the We name, for their direct marketing purposes.
